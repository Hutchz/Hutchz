👋 Hi, I’m @Hutchz (Sebastian)

👀 I’m interested in learning about coding and acquiring multiple skills to upgrade my life. 

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JavaScript, HTML, and database management.

      "<Right now, I'm super involved with web3... Mainly with Worldcoin proyect. For now, I'm just a community helper, but getting involved in this project has given me a great         
        perspective in this year 2024... learning more about blockchain and other programming languages.>"

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project where I can be of help.
